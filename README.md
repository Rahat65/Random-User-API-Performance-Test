# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

## About this project:
### In this project I have performed the load test and stress test in a specific website which is " https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/users "

## Tools & Technology Used: 
- Jmeter
- JDK 17.0

## Scenario:
Find out the actual TPS for if 120000 users can give load for 12 hours
1. You have to find out if the expected TPS (Transaction Per/Second) meet the above requirement. Breakdown the expected TPS in excel sheet and find out the actual TPS.
2. Create another excel sheet where you will try to find out the bottleneck/stress test point. (At which point the system starts to show 1% error)

## How to run:
- Clone this project
- Save the .jmx file in the bin folder of Jmeter
- Run the file using Jmeter
